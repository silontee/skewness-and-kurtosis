3.?. Match Outcomes: International Football Results Dataset
In sports analytics, modeling the aggregate scoring intensity is a fundamental task for strength estimation and match forecasting. The international football dataset provides historical records and match features for 49,071 international matches spanning from 1872 to 2026. This dataset is a prototypical candidate for orthogonal expansions because it exhibits significant over-dispersion—with a sample mean of 2.94 goals and a notably larger variance of 4.38—and a pronounced right tail where rare, high-scoring events reach a maximum of 31 goals. Approximately 67.3% of the matches result in 3 goals or fewer, creating a distribution with a high concentration of low-count outcomes but significant volatility in the upper percentiles.

Using a Negative Binomial (NB) expansion, a researcher can start with a baseline that accommodates this over-dispersion and utilize Meixner polynomials to adjust for the skewness and kurtosis caused by these extreme scoring events. This method allows the model to "graduate" the frequency curve to account for the heavy right tail that standard Poisson models, which assume equal mean and variance, significantly underestimate in the context of international football's diverse tactical history.
